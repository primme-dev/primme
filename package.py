class Primme(MakefilePackage):
    """"PRIMME, pronounced as prime, is a high-performance library for computing a few eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and
    singular values/vectors. PRIMME is especially optimized for large, difficult problems. Real symmetric and complex
    Hermitian problems, standard 洧냢洧논 = 洧랝洧논 and generalized 洧냢洧논 = 洧랝洧냣洧논, are supported. Besides standard eigenvalue
    problems with a normal matrix are supported. It can find largest, smallest, or interior singular/eigenvalues, and can
    use preconditioning to accelerate convergence. PRIMME is written in C99, but complete interfaces are provided for
    Fortran, MATLAB, Python, and R."""
